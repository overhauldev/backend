How to setup and run the backend:

Ensure you have Node.js installed

In the backend directory, open the terminal and run:
```console
npm run setup-and-run
```

This automates the installation process and runs the server automatically. 

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure Node.js is installed, run node -v in your terminal for confirmation
- If installing dependencies fails, try deleting node_modules and package-lock.json, then run npm install.

Once the server starts successfully, you should see the development server running at http://localhost:5000.
